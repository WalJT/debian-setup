# debian-setup

A few scripts that I use to set up my Debian workstations.
You may find them useful too, but they are specific to me
and make a few assumptions:

1. The operating system is Debian `12.x` (Bookworm)
2. The KDE Plasma desktop environment was chosen during installation
3. You are OK with non-free software repos being enabled
4. You want Flatpak packages when available

Feel free to modify these scripts to meet your own needs.
